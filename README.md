# BattleShip-Game
The repository contains a text-based JavaScript game that I created for a school project. The game is based on BattleShip.

## How to Play

Upon running the script, the game will prompt the player to select the coordinates and direction of the bows of their two battleships. The game takes place on a 12 x 12 coordinate plane and will automatically correct the player's ships if they are placed out of the game area.

Once the player's ships are placed, the game will randomly place two enemy ships on a 12 x 12 plane. The player will now be prompted to choose coordinates to "shoot" and will be notified if the coordinate they chose landed on an enemy battleship. Each round the player and the enemy will both shoot once, with the enemy shots landing on random coordinates. A battleship is sunk when all its points on the plane are hit with a shot.

The player will be prompted to end the game at the end of each round after five rounds. The game also ends once either the player or the enemy has all their battleships sunk.
